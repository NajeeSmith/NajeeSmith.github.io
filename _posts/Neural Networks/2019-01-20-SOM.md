# Introduction
Thought these were coolio
# Code

```python
#Training
from minisom import MiniSom #the SOM function
ms = MiniSom(x = 10, y = 10, input_len = 15, sigma = 1, learning_rate = .5)
ms.random_weights_init(X)
ms.train_random(data = X, num_iteration = 150)
```
**REPLACE WITH IMAGE OF MAP YOU TURD**

```python
from pylab import bone,pcolor,colorbar, plot, show
bone()
pcolor(ms.distance_map().T)
colorbar()
markers = ['o','x']
colors = ['r', 'g']
for i, x in enumerate(X):
    win = ms.winner(x)
    plot(win[0] + 0.5,
         win[1] + 0.5,
         markers[Y[i]],
         markeredgecolor = colors[Y[i]],
         markerfacecolor = 'None',
         markersize = 10,
         markeredgewidth = 2)
show()
```
The results of the map are rather intuitive. The lighter colors are associated
with a greater distance to the winning node. The markers on the graph represent
whether or not the customers were approved. This raises a few eyebrows if there
are approved customers with relatively high distances. These potential frauds were
listed with the following code.

```python
mapping = ms.win_map(X) #Finding customers associated to winning nodes
frauds = np.concatenate((mapping[(7,5)],mapping[(7,6)]), axis = 0) #Inputs are the most suspicious neurons
frauds = sc.inverse_transform(frauds) #Gives the id numbers for the possible cheaters
```
# Results
Having a list of potential fraudulent customers is great, however a further step
could be taken to determine whether or not other, or future customers, actually are
as well. Utilizing my previous knowledge of Artificial Neural Networks made this section rather
direct.

```python
customers = data.iloc[:, 1:].values
potential_fraud = np.zeros(len(data))
for i in range(len(data)):
    if data.iloc[i,0] in frauds:
        potential_fraud[i] = 1

# Importing the Keras libraries and packages
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense

# Initialising the ANN
classifier = Sequential()

# Adding the input layer and the first hidden layer
classifier.add(Dense(units = 2, kernel_initializer = 'uniform', activation = 'relu', input_dim = 15))

# Adding the output layer
classifier.add(Dense(units = 1, kernel_initializer = 'uniform', activation = 'sigmoid'))

# Compiling the ANN
classifier.compile(optimizer = 'adam', loss = 'binary_crossentropy', metrics = ['accuracy'])

# Fitting the ANN to the Training set
classifier.fit(customers, potential_fraud, batch_size = 1, epochs = 2)

# Predicting the probabilities of frauds
y_pred = classifier.predict(customers)
y_pred = np.concatenate((data.iloc[:, 0:1].values, y_pred), axis = 1) #Brings array of prediction values and customer IDs
y_pred = y_pred[y_pred[:, 1].argsort()] #Ascending list of fraud probabilities
```

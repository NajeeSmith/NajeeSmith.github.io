# Introduction
I understand that NLP itself is not a classifier, however I just put it here since it is used in tangent with them.
The data set I received was given by the Udemy course I was taking at the time. The data was a list of restaurant reviews with the aim of sorting them into either positive or negative reviews. It was a fun experience learning, however I felt it was a bit trite, and wanted to try my hand at another application of this: sorting emails by whether they are spam or legitimate.

# Code

```python
import pandas as pd
import nltk
import re
nltk.download('stopwords')
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.stem.porter import PorterStemmer
```

## Restaurant Review

```python
corpus = [] #Collection of the individual reviews
for i in range(0, 1000):
    review = re.sub('[^a-zA-Z]', ' ', data['Review'][i])
    review = review.lower() #lower case all words"
    review = review.split() #Splits words
    stem = PorterStemmer() #Gets for stem
    review = [stem.stem(word) for word in review if not word in set(stopwords.words('english'))] #Ignores certain words that are common such as "this"
    review =' '. join(review) #Join all extra spaces in reviews
    corpus.append(review) #Create the collection of review words

#Bag of Words Model via tokenization
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
vector = CountVectorizer(max_features = 1500) #Extracts features of unique 1500 words
X = vector.fit_transform(corpus).toarray()
y = data.iloc[:, 1].values
```

## Spam
One small difference between the two processes is that instead of stemming I was going to try to use a lemmatizer. In doing so, I was hoping to see if having words that aren't broken from stemming would have an effect.

# Results
Both used the Gaussian classifier since the data would be a little more complex than just being linearly separable.

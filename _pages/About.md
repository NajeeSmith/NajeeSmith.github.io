I am a self-taught ML programmer with ambitions of being a data scientist,
with a background in Chemical Engineering. I enjoy learning about AI,
technology, and the brilliant mathematics that make it all work. A brief list
of skills I have acquired throughout my journey are Python, SQL, and Git.
My full resume can be viewed [here.]()
**Will link once resume is complete (which is soon!)**

I am a self-taught data analyst with a background in Chemical Engineering. I have worked with a large variety of data sets, and have found a passion for it. I enjoy learning about AI,
technology, and the brilliant mathematics that make it all work. A brief list
of skills I have acquired throughout my journey are Python, SQL, and Pytorch.
